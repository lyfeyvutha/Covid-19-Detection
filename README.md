# Covid-19-Detection

Research:

1. How to import images into machine learning model
2. The images are different sizes, so learn to normalize them, somehow.
3. The images are different formats, png, jpeg, jpg how do we work with this.
4. The covid dataset for images that have covid is only 125 images. Pretty small? Might affect accuracy alot.
